    The form submits credentials to the PageModel so authentication logic
    remains centralized and testable in the service layer.

        Username is collected to uniquely identify the account.
        Any validation or lookup is intentionally deferred to the backend.

        Password input is masked at the UI level to reduce
        the risk of accidental exposure during entry.

        Authentication feedback is displayed only after submission
        to avoid revealing account existence or system behavior.
